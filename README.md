# Description

This is FreeCAD macro for woodworking to apply and store textures.

Currently the URL to the texture can be stored at FreeCAD project at objects description (Label2). In the future this macro will be improved to get more possibilities to store URL (material card, dedicated object's property). Currently it is prototype state but is working fine and allow to store different textures from the internet for objects.
